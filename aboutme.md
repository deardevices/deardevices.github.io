Hi, I'm Steffen. I create Embedded Software for a living.

Professionally, I'm interested in Modern C++ on constrained platforms, which is typical for Embedded. This goes together with Architecture and Design. I always strive to improve the quality of my code by studying new methods, paradigms and technologies.

Besides that, I enjoy fine-tuning my text editor, low-level microcontroller programming, the Linux OS and playing around with my home espresso machine. At the end of 2023 I got into Amateur Radio, so get ready to see some of that content in the feature!

This blog is about my private projects, opinions are my own.
