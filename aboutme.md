Hi, I'm Steffen. I create Embedded software for a living.

I always strive to improve the quality of my code by studying new methods, paradigms and technologies.

Besides that, I enjoy fine-tuning my text editor, low-level microcontroller programming, the Linux OS and playing around with my home espresso machine.

This blog is about my private projects, opinions are my own.
